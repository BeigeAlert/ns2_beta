-- Here's what I did: Copy+pasted CheckMeleeCapsule and renamed it CheckMeleeCapsuleHelper and made
-- it a local function.  Made a slight modification to it to differentiate between glancing blows.
-- Then added CheckMeleeCapsule function back in that first tries CheckMeleeCapsuleHelper without
-- glancing hits, then, if it misses, tries with the glancing hits.  Appears the same from an
-- external point of view, except that an extra return value "wasGlancing" is returned at the end.

 * compensate by doing multiple traces.
